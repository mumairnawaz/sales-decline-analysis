## Background

An established e-commerce business experienced a noticeable decline in revenue after a period of stable growth. While pricing and average order value remained largely unchanged, overall sales performance weakened year over year. This case study investigates why sales declined, where demand softened, and which operational and customer-level factors contributed most, using historical transaction data from 2020–2024. The objective is to uncover actionable business insights that leadership can use to stabilize revenue and restore sustainable growth.

## Executive Summary

This analysis reviews multi-year e-commerce performance between **2020 and 2024** to understand the underlying drivers behind a sustained revenue decline following a period of growth. While total revenue peaked during the mid-period, subsequent years showed a consistent slowdown primarily driven by a reduction in order volume, not by pricing pressure or changes in average order value. Average order value remained broadly stable, indicating that customers continued to spend similar amounts per transaction, but purchased less frequently over time. Revenue generation became increasingly concentrated among a limited set of high-performing products, customers, and locations. This concentration supported short-term revenue stability but increased exposure to demand volatility when purchasing behavior softened. At the same time, customer acquisition slowed materially, shifting revenue reliance toward existing customers and repeat activity rather than sustained new demand. Overall, the findings suggest that the revenue decline reflects structural demand and engagement challenges, rather than tactical pricing or discounting issues, highlighting the need for targeted action across customer growth, retention, and operational efficiency.

# Key Business Insights

<table width="90%" align="center">

## Sales Trends & Order Volume Decline

Between 2021 and 2024, total revenue reached **approximately $254M**, with performance peaking in 2023 before declining sharply in 2024. The revenue drop of nearly **19% year-over-year in 2024** closely mirrors a similar decline in order volume, which fell from 56K orders in 2023 to 45K in 2024. In contrast, Average Order Value (AOV) remained relatively stable throughout the period, fluctuating within a narrow range around $1.35K. This stability indicates that customers continued to spend similar amounts per transaction, and pricing or discounting pressure was not the primary driver of revenue decline.

**Business implication:**
The slowdown is fundamentally demand-driven, caused by fewer purchases rather than lower spend per order. Restoring revenue growth will therefore require increasing order frequency and customer engagement, not price adjustments.

## Customer Growth vs Retention Patterns

Customer behavior shifted significantly over the analysis period. In 2021, revenue was supported by a strong inflow of new customers. However, new customer acquisition dropped sharply from 2022 onward, approaching near-zero growth in subsequent years. Despite this, returning customers continued to generate the majority of revenue, contributing over **$77M in 2023 and $62M in 2024**. While this repeat-customer base provided short-term stability, overall revenue still declined as repeat purchase activity softened and was unable to fully compensate for the absence of new customers.

**Business implication:**
The business has become increasingly reliant on a mature customer base, increasing exposure to demand volatility. Without renewed acquisition or stronger retention initiatives, revenue growth remains structurally constrained.

## Product Performance & Revenue Concentration

Revenue contribution is highly concentrated across a limited number of product categories. Electronics alone accounts for approximately 48% of total revenue ($122M), followed by** Home & Garden (18%) and Sports (15%)**. Together, these three categories generate over **80%** of total sales. While order counts are relatively evenly distributed across categories, higher-value categories disproportionately drive revenue. As overall **demand declined in 2024**, this concentration amplified revenue contraction, as underperforming categories lacked sufficient scale to offset weakness in core segments.

**Business implication:**
High category concentration supports strong performance during growth periods but increases downside risk during demand slowdowns. Revenue resilience would benefit from broader category diversification and cross-selling strategies.

## Operational Risk: Delivery Speed & Return Behavior

Operational performance, particularly delivery speed, shows a clear relationship with return behavior. Orders classified under **slow delivery exhibit a return rate of 6.7%**, more than three times higher than **fast or medium deliveries (approximately 2%)**. Although return losses are not the primary driver of revenue decline, elevated return risk linked to slower fulfillment contributes to margin erosion and reduced customer satisfaction, potentially discouraging repeat purchases.

**Business implication:**
Delivery performance acts as a demand friction factor. Improving fulfillment speed can reduce return losses, protect margins, and support customer retention—especially in high-value categories.

# Strategic Recommendations


<table width="90%" align="center">
<tr><td>


## Reignite Customer Acquisition with Targeted Growth Controls

New customer acquisition declined materially after the initial growth phase, limiting the business’s ability to replenish demand. Rather than broad, high-cost acquisition campaigns, growth efforts should focus on high-intent channels and data-driven targeting.

**Buiness Actions To Take:**

- Prioritizing acquisition in high-performing regions and product categories
- Leveraging referral and loyalty-driven onboarding
- Closely monitoring acquisition cost versus lifetime value to maintain profitability
- This approach rebuilds demand while avoiding margin erosion.

---

## Strengthen Retention and Purchase Frequency Among Existing Customers

With revenue increasingly dependent on returning customers, stabilizing order volume requires improving repeat-purchase behavior. Retention initiatives should aim to increase engagement frequency rather than transaction size.

**Buiness Actions To Take:**

- Personalized re-engagement campaigns based on purchase history
- Time-based incentives tied to replenishment or repeat usage cycles
- Improved post-purchase communication and lifecycle messaging
- Improving retention directly addresses the volume-driven nature of the revenue decline.

---

## Reduce Revenue Concentration Through Product Portfolio Expansion

Revenue is heavily concentrated within a small number of product categories, increasing vulnerability during demand slowdowns. Expanding the contribution of secondary categories can improve revenue resilience.

**Buiness Actions To Take:**

- Cross-selling complementary products alongside top-performing categories
- Bundling lower-penetration categories with high-demand items
- Using performance data to identify underutilized categories with growth potential
- A more balanced portfolio reduces dependency on a narrow revenue base.

---

## Improve Operational Performance to Protect Demand and Margins

Operational friction, particularly slower delivery performance, is associated with higher return rates and weaker repeat behavior. Improving fulfillment efficiency can support both customer satisfaction and profitability.

**Buiness Actions To Take:**

- Prioritizing faster delivery options for high-value orders and repeat customers
- Monitoring return behavior by delivery speed and product category
- Aligning fulfillment performance metrics with customer experience outcomes
- Operational improvements act as a demand enabler rather than a cost center.
