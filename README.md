## Background

An established e-commerce business experienced a noticeable decline in revenue after a period of stable growth. While pricing and average order value remained largely unchanged, overall sales performance weakened year over year. This case study investigates why sales declined, where demand softened, and which operational and customer-level factors contributed most, using historical transaction data from 2020–2024. The objective is to uncover actionable business insights that leadership can use to stabilize revenue and restore sustainable growth.
